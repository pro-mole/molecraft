Molecraft Mod Directory
=======================

An  extensive change of approach is being taken now. It basically boils down to: Molecraft was too big and too aimless to actually go anywhere with my short window of attention at any given time. This now is an attempt to turn the whole mod into smaller mods that will be mostly independent.

The first one will be the Bug mod. It'll include:

- Bug catching(grub traps, water traps, bug nets)
- The Terrarium(and variants)
- Bug breeding(via special breeding environment)
- And of course, the bugs(tool bugs, food bugs, block bugs, resource bugs, crafting bugs, neat item bugs, and much more!)
